# This works on p5.js

### Getting Started

- Clone this repo. 
- Get an http-server (localhost) of your choice, like Python http.server or Atom server.
- Run this server in ROOT directory. p5.js libraries are already there.
- Head over to Chrome (just sayin') and navigate to your localhost port.
- Index.html is the real deal. Click on it.
- Press F12 to see `console.log(..)` outputs.

This, I did as a part of learning to code. Head over to Daniel Shiffman's YouTube channel: Coding Train if you want more cherries.
